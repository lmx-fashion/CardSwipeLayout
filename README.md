## Usage

### step 1

For build.gradle :

	compile 'me.yuqirong:cardswipelayout:1.0.0'

Or Maven :

	<dependency>
	  <groupId>me.yuqirong</groupId>
	  <artifactId>cardswipelayout</artifactId>
	  <version>1.0.0</version>
	  <type>pom</type>
	</dependency>

### step 2

init RecyclerView firstly :

``` java
RecyclerView recyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recyclerView);
recyclerView.setAdapter(...);
```

### step 3

then set `CardLayoutManager` for RecyclerView and `CardItemTouchHelperCallback` for ItemTouchHelper . In addition , don't forget set `OnSwipeListener` for `CardItemTouchHelperCallback` :

``` java
// dataList means dataSource for adapter
CardItemTouchHelperCallback cardCallback = new CardItemTouchHelperCallback(recyclerView.getAdapter(), dataList);
ItemTouchHelper touchHelper = new ItemTouchHelper(cardCallback); CardLayoutManager cardLayoutManager = new CardLayoutManager(recyclerView, touchHelper);
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(cardLayoutManager);
touchHelper.attachToRecyclerView(recyclerView);
cardCallback.setOnSwipedListener(new OnSwipeListener<T>() {

    @Override
    public void onSwiping(RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder, float ratio, int direction) {
        /**
         * will callback when the card are swiping by user
         * viewHolder : thee viewHolder of swiping card
         * ratio : the ratio of swiping , you can add some animation by the ratio
         * direction : CardConfig.SWIPING_LEFT means swiping from left；CardConfig.SWIPING_RIGHT means swiping from right
         *             CardConfig.SWIPING_NONE means not left nor right
         */
    }

    @Override
    public void onSwiped(RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder, T t, int direction) {
	    /**
	     *  will callback when the card swiped from screen by user
	     *  you can also clean animation from the itemview of viewHolder in this method
	     *  viewHolder : the viewHolder of swiped cards
	     *  t : the data of swiped cards from dataList
	     *  direction : CardConfig.SWIPED_LEFT means swiped from left；CardConfig.SWIPED_RIGHT means swiped from right
	     */
    }

    @Override
    public void onSwipedClear() {
        /**
         *  will callback when all cards swiped clear
         *  you can load more data 
         */
    }

});
```

Finally , enjoy it !!!
